 the code performs iris flower classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with Scikit-learn. Here's a summary of what each step does:

Download the Iris dataset (not shown in the code).
Install Scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning.
Load the Iris dataset using pandas and display the first few rows.
Preprocess the data by splitting it into features and labels, and further split it into training and testing sets.
Create a KNN classifier, train it on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix.
Demonstrate making predictions on new, unseen data.
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the iris flower measurements and classify them into one of the three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.
